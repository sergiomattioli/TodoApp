# TodoApp Android - Jetpack Compose MVVM

This example project showcases a TodoApp for Android devices, developed using the latest Android technologies and architectures, including Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Hilt, Room, and Clean Architecture. This application serves as a solid starting point for those looking to explore best practices in modern Android app development.

## Key Features

- **Jetpack Compose UI:** The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, the modern UI toolkit for Android that simplifies UI development through declarative programming.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** The MVVM architecture is implemented to clearly separate UI logic and business logic. This facilitates testing, maintenance, and code scalability.

- **Hilt:** Dependency injection is efficiently managed through Hilt, simplifying the creation and management of class instances throughout the application.

- **Room Database:** Room is used to manage data persistence locally in the application. Pending tasks are stored efficiently in an SQLite database.

- **Clean Architecture:** The application follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure the separation of layers and ease of testing. Business logic, user interface, and data layer are clearly defined and isolated.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clear and layered structure, making it easy to expand and understand the code. Key layers include:

- **app:** Contains application-specific logic, such as the user interface and presentation logic.

- **data:** Stores data sources and repository implementations.

- **domain:** Defines use cases and domain entities.

- **di:** Hilt configuration for dependency injection.

## System Requirements

- Android Studio 4.0 or higher
- Android device with a compatible Android version

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Connect to an Android device or use an emulator to run the application.

You're all set! Now, you have a solid foundation to build your own TodoApp using the latest Android technologies. Explore the code, experiment, and customize as per your needs.

This project is an ongoing effort to stay up-to-date with Android development best practices. If you encounter issues or potential improvements, feel free to contribute or report them through issues. Enjoy developing with Android Jetpack Compose!
